						<li><h3>From Joel Shimeles the 21th November 2022</h3></li>
						<p> The best hotel Iâ€™ve ever been privileged enough to stay at. Gorgeous building, and it only gets more breathtaking when you walk in. High quality rooms (there was even a tv by the shower), and high quality service. Also, they are one of few hotels that allow people under 21 to book a reservation.</p>
